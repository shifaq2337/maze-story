# Don't Follow Instruction

---

You decide not to follow intstructions (which isn't really the smartest idea). Your abductor does not have any problems with you not following their instruction. You get captured by really chill people, but that doesn't stop them from setting traps. You encounter a trap as you walk around the maze!
